# texttable

This package imports tabular data that is stored in a variety of text formats.
It uses [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) to convert various formats to HTML and then
imports them via `rvest::html_table`.

## Install

    devtools::install_github('noamross/texttable')

## Usage


Enter tabular in the text format of your choice:

```{r}
library(texttable)
sample_table = "
                | My | Tabular  | Data |
                |----|----------|------|
                |   1| Sample 1 | 0.3  |
                |   2| Sample 2 | 1.2  |
               "
imported = texttable(sample_table)
imported
```

Note that `texttable()` will trim leading whitespace from character inputs by default.

Get tables out of text files, and even MS Word files:

```{r}
tables = texttable('tests/testthat/tables.markdown')
tables[[1]]
word_tables = texttable('tests/testthat/tables.docx')
word_tables[[1]]
```

## Known issues

Pandoc conversion of tables from `latex`, `haddock`, `odt`, formats has known issues and
does not always work. For these formats `texttable` will provide a warning,
as the output quality is unknown and will change with your current version of
Pandoc.
